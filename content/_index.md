I am a Junior Research Fellow working on stability of complex systems under Dr. Chandrakala Meena at IISER Thiruvananthapuram. I am interested in quantum computing, information and computational complexity.

I was at IIT Gandhinagar for MSc Physics. Before that, I was at Jamia Millia Islamia for BSc (Hons.) Physics.
